## Contracts

`dOrgProjectFactory.sol` -- Factory that makes lighthweight clones of `dOrgProject.sol`.

`dOrgProject.sol` -- Wrapper for `PaymentSplitterInitializable.sol`. Stores metadata such as project name. Uses `Initializable.sol` to prevent double-initialization attack.

- `getName()`. Returns project name. 

`PaymentSplitterInitializable.sol` -- OpenZeppelin payment splitter without `constructor()` function, replaced by `initialize()` as lightweight clones cannot have `constructor()` function. Uses `Initializable.sol` to prevent double-initialization attack.
